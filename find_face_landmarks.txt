%DLIB_FIND_FACE_LANDMARKS Find face landmarks in a video or image sequence
%   frames = DLIB_FIND_FACE_LANDMARKS(modelFile, inputPath, scale) 
%   Input:
%       modelFile - Path to the landmarks model file
%       inputPath - Path to a video file or a directory containing a
%       sequence of images
%       scale [=1] - Each frame will be scaled by this factor. Useful for
%       detection of small faces. The landmarks will still be in the
%       original frame's pixel coordinates
%   Output:
%       frames - An array of frames, each frame contains the width and
%       height of the frame and an array of faces that were detected in
%       that frame. Each face contain its bounding box in the format 
%       [x y width height], and its detected landmarks as a n-by-2 matrix
%       (n is the number of points in the model). 
%
%   frames = DLIB_FIND_FACE_LANDMARKS(modelFile, device, width, height, scale) 
%   this is the live version. device is the camera's id to start the 
%   preview from. width and height are the requested preview resolution.
